Given an input, you need to print it and move the cursor to the next line.

Example 1:

Input:
myInput = "Hello World"
Output: 
Hello World
Explanation: The input is "Hello World",
and we just print it.

Your Task: 
Just write the syntax to print the variable that stores the input. The input code is already provided.

Solution:
public static void utility(String MyInput){
    //Write your code below that prints myInput


    //Write your code below that prints myInput
    
    System.out.println(MyInput);
}
