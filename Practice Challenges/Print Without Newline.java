As we have seen, the System.out.println() statement automatically appends a new line to our output. Here, we'll learn how to prevent that.
You are given two string variables a and b, and you have to print a and b with a space between them. However, you must prevent the print statement from providing a new line as the new line will be given by the main driver code.

Example 1:

Input:
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
Output: 
Hello World
Explanation: a and b are printed in a
single line and a space separates
them.The new line is provided by the
driver code.

Your Task: 
Just write the syntax to print a and b in a single line with a space in between them while preventing print from providing a new line as the new line is auto appended by the driver code.
 
Solution:
public static void utility(String a, String b){
     
    //Write your code below. 


    //Write your code below.
    System.out.print(a+" "+b);
}
