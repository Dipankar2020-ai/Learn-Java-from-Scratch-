Given two inputs that are stored in variables a and b, you need to print a and b in a single line without space between them.

Example 1:

Input:
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
Output: 
HelloWorld
Explanation: a and b are printed in a
single line without space between them.

Your Task: 
Just write the syntax to print a and b in a single line without space in between them. The input code is already provided

Solution:
public static void utility(String a, String b){

        //Write your code below that prints ab
        System.out.println(a+b);

}
