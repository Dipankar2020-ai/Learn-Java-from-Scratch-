You'll be given two strings a and b, a separator symbol, and you need to print a and b such that a and b are separated by the separator symbol.

Example 1:

Input:
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
separator = "@"
Output: 
Hello@World
Explanation: a and b are printed
with the separator symbol in between.

Your Task: 
Just write the syntax to print a and b in a single line with the separator symbol in between them. The input has already been provided.
  
 Solution:
public static void utility(String a, String b, String separator){

    //Your code below
    System.out.println(a+separator+b);

}
