Given two inputs that are store in variables a and b, you need to print a and b in a single line with a space separating them.

Example 1:

Input:
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
Output: 
Hello World
Explanation: a and b are printed in a
single line and a space separates them.

Your Task: 
Just write the syntax to print a and b in a single line with a space in between them. The input code is already provided

Solution:
public static void utility(String a, String b){

    //Write your code below that prints a <space> b
    
    
    
    //Write your code below that prints a <space> b
    System.out.println(a+" "+b);

}
